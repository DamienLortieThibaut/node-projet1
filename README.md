## 🎯 Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a REST API that will manage different Raudi car models, providing features such as creation, update, deletion, and retrieval of information about these models. We aim to make this car management as efficient and user-friendly as possible.

## 🔑 Key Features
Raudi's automobile management system offers the following features:

1. **Model List**: Users can view the list of car models offered by Raudi on the homepage.

2. **Detailed Model Sheet**: By clicking on a specific model, users can access a detailed sheet with more information about the characteristics of that model.

3. **Restricted Access to Options**: Users are not allowed to modify the options of the models via the public interface.

4. **Accounting**: Company accountants have access to a special interface where they can view a history of all purchases made by customers. Additionally, they have a monthly total gain report to facilitate their accounting work.

5. **Connected Client Features**: Clients who are logged into the application have access to additional features that enhance their user experience.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Users
The application is designed to serve multiple types of users:

- **Clients**: Raudi's customers can use the application to browse the model range, access additional features when logged in, and make car purchases.

- **Accountants**: Company accountants have access to specific features to manage finances and generate reports.
